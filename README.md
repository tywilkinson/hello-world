##What it does
The program asks for a message, user name, user age, and the user's favorite food. It will then print out the message, then the user's name, and then finally the line *name* is *age* and their favorite food is *food*

##How to use it
1. Clone the code from github into a local directory. From here you can run the code in any environment that runs python code.
2. To use the software, simply run it and answer any prompted questions that appear in the terminal. All data processing will be done behind the scenes and values will be printed back out to terminal.

##How to contribute
Feel free to make any edits by creating a forked branch in github, from here you can clone your own repository and make any edits. Please do your best to leave clear comments so I can quickly review the code. Make sure to leave a comment with your name so you can be listed as a contributer! Finally, create a pull request with a short message so that we can see your edit and approve it. Thank you for any modifications!
